# Craps Dice Game

This game is written as part of a lesson in an OOP course I am taking.    
I am writing this before I watch the lesson where the instructor explains their approach to the game. 

## Rules of the Game.

You get two rolls. 
### 1. The Coming Out Roll

* If you roll a 7 or 11 you win.
* If you roll a 2, 3, or 12 you lose.
* Any other number (3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) becomes your Point Number. And you go on to roll 2. 

### 2. The Point Number Roll

* You keep rolling the dice until you match the Point Number or get a 7. 
* If you match the Point Number you win. 
* If you roll a 7, you lose.
